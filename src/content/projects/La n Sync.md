A complete system that manages Grant Writers, including a User, Grant Writer, and Admin system.

This system allows users to search for a Grant Writer that fits their needs, offering search options by name, firm, and advanced filters such as city, specialty, and availability. It also includes a registration system for users wishing to sign up as Grant Writers, enabling them to create a profile with detailed characteristics, descriptions, and relevant attributes. Registered Grant Writers can log in at any time to update their information, receive notifications when added to a project, view their assigned projects, and accept or decline participation.

Additionally, the system features an administrative panel for managing Grant Writers and firmsâ€”collections of Grant Writers who can be added or removed from the firm. The administrator can modify any necessary information, review and approve newly registered Grant Writer profiles, and ensure their inclusion on the platform. Lastly, administrators can create new projects and send them to all registered Grant Writers, allowing them to evaluate and decide whether to join the project.
