<h1 class="text-7xl">About Me</h1>
I am a passionate software developer with expertise in frontend and backend development. I love writing clean code, building user-friendly interfaces, and creating efficient solutions to complex problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies or contributing to open source projects.
I have extensive experience working with React, Node.js, and related technologies in professional settings. Over the past 3-4 years, I've successfully delivered multiple web applications while collaborating with cross-functional teams. I've implemented complex features, optimized application performance, and mentored junior developers. My daily work involves writing modular code, conducting code reviews, and following agile development practices.
